  <h3>Cover Letter</h3>
  <p>
    To the Hiring Manager:
    <br>
    <br>
    Dear Sir/Madam,
    <br>
    <br>
    Intrigued by your open position in Software development, I request you to please review my enclosed resume.<br>
    I believe that I possess a unique combination of knowledge and skills that would help propel a team towards the successful achievement of their software development goals.<br>
    For instance, during my Bachelor of Biomedical Engineering from Toronto Metropolitan (formerly Ryerson) University, I completed such courses as computer programming and microcontrollers, which focus on procedural, object oriented and embedded programming.<br>
    Thereafter, I gained 5 years of experience in the research and development of robotics and consumer electronics, my primary responsibility being the software development life cycle of these products.<br>
    I consider C and C++ to be my strongest programming languages with a combined 12 years of experience between them.  I therefore believe I have the necessary qualifications for this position.<br>
    I’m a creative at heart and thrive solving interesting, meaningful, and challenging problems.<br>
    Thank you for reading and for your kind consideration.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact my former colleagues after 5 PM (EST) or myself during the day.<br>
    <br>
    Sincerely,
    <br>
    <br>
    David D’Souza, B.Eng
